## My blog website 
*inspired by [writefreely](https://writefreely.org/)*

I wanted to create something myself and learn more about JavaScript (yes i know backend is in Python) so I created this project.
I like simple look of writefreely and wanted to do something similar.

**TODO:**
- write installation tutorial  
- whitelist based on domain [almost done]
- optimize loading
