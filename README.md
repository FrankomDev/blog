## My blog website [WIP] 
*inspired by [writefreely](https://writefreely.org/)*

I wanted to create something myself and learn more about JavaScript (yes i know backend is in Python) so I created this project.
I like simple look of writefreely and wanted to do something similar.

**TODO:**
- admin page upgrade
- post deleting
- post modifying
